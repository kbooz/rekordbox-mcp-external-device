# Rekordbox MCP Server

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for rekordbox database management with real-time database access.

**Built using [pyrekordbox](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox)** - This project is not affiliated with the pyrekordbox project or its maintainers.

> **Fork note:** [kbooz/rekordbox-mcp-external-device](https://github.com/kbooz/rekordbox-mcp-external-device) extends the upstream project with access to **rekordbox exports on external devices** — the USB sticks and SD cards you take to the club — using [rekordbox-pdb](https://github.com/fragmede/rekordbox-pdb). See [External Device Exports](#-external-device-exports-usb--sd-cards).

## ⚠️ Important Safety Notice

**BACKUP YOUR REKORDBOX LIBRARY BEFORE USE**

This software directly accesses your rekordbox database. **Always create a backup** of your entire rekordbox library before using this tool as a precautionary measure.

### Backup Requirements

**You should create a complete backup of your rekordbox library before using this software.** Consult rekordbox documentation or support resources for proper backup procedures for your specific setup and rekordbox version.

### Risk Acknowledgment

- ⚠️ **This project accesses your rekordbox database directly**
- ⚠️ **Use at your own risk - no warranty provided**  
- ⚠️ **Test thoroughly with backups before using on your main library**
- ⚠️ **The developers are not responsible for any data loss or damage**

**If you are not comfortable with these risks, use the read-only XML export functionality instead.**

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- rekordbox 6 or 7 installed with an existing library
- **COMPLETE BACKUP** of your rekordbox library (see safety notice above)
- **Read-only tools** (search, stats, history) work while rekordbox is open
- **Write tools** (create playlist, add tracks, cleanup) require **rekordbox to be closed** — pyrekordbox blocks commits when rekordbox is running
- Access to your rekordbox database (automatic detection supported)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# Run the server
uv run rekordbox-mcp
```

### Configuration

The server supports both automatic database detection and manual configuration:

```bash
# Auto-detect rekordbox database (recommended)
uv run rekordbox-mcp

# Specify custom database path
uv run rekordbox-mcp --database-path /path/to/rekordbox/Pioneer
```

### MCP Client Setup

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rekordbox-database": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "rekordbox-mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/rekordbox-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools (35 tools + 1 resource)

### Playlist Operations
- **`get_playlists`** - List all playlists including smart playlists
- **`get_playlist_tracks`** - Get all tracks in a specific playlist
- **`create_playlist`** - Create new playlist or folder ⚠️ (Mutation)
- **`add_track_to_playlist`** - Add single track to playlist ⚠️ (Mutation)

- **`get_history_stats`** - Comprehensive DJ performance statistics and insights

### Track Import
- **`import_track`** - Import a single audio file into the library; reads ID3 tags via mutagen by default, accepts metadata overrides ⚠️ (Mutation)
- **`import_tracks`** - Batch-import files and/or directories (recursive, extension filter); returns track IDs for follow-up playlist actions ⚠️ (Mutation)

> ℹ️ Imported tracks are **unanalyzed** — waveforms, beatgrids, and hot cues are generated by rekordbox itself. After import, open rekordbox and run *Analyze Tracks* on the new imports. Supported formats: mp3, m4a, flac, wav, aiff.

### Library Cleanup
- **`find_broken_tracks`** - Scan for missing files, Apple Music streams, empty paths, and orphaned playlist refs
- **`cleanup_orphaned_playlist_entries`** - Remove stale playlist entries referencing deleted tracks ⚠️ (Mutation)
- **`remove_broken_tracks`** - Soft-delete tracks by ID and remove from all playlists ⚠️ (Destructive)

### External Device Exports (USB / SD cards)
- **`list_devices`** - List connected devices containing a rekordbox export, with track/playlist counts
- **`get_device_playlists`** - Get the playlist tree (folders + playlists) from a device
- **`get_device_playlist_tracks`** - Get a device playlist's tracks in DJ-visible order
- **`search_device_tracks`** - Search a device's tracks by title, artist, album, or genre

> ℹ️ These read `PIONEER/rekordbox/export.pdb` on the mounted device — the DeviceSQL database the CDJs actually read. It is **not encrypted**, so these tools need no key and work while rekordbox is open. They are strictly read-only: a device export is a build artifact of rekordbox, and editing it in place would desync the device.
>
> `device_path` is optional when exactly one device is connected. With several mounted, the tools raise rather than guess which stick you meant.

### Database Management
- **`connect_database`** - Explicitly connect with optional custom database path

### Resources
- **`database-status`** - Current connection status and basic stats

⚠️ **Mutation operations** modify your rekordbox database and create automatic backups  
⚠️ **Destructive operations** permanently delete data and require extra confirmation

## Examples

### Search for tracks by key and BPM
```python
# Find tracks in 5A key with BPM between 120-130
search_tracks(key="5A", bpm_min=120, bpm_max=130, limit=20)
```

```python
# Get recent DJ sessions
get_recent_sessions(days=30)

# Get tracks from a specific session
get_session_tracks(session_id="12345")
```


### Get library insights
```python
# Comprehensive library statistics
get_library_stats()

# DJ performance statistics
get_history_stats()
```

### Playlist Management
```python
# Create a new playlist
create_playlist(name="Hidden Bangers", parent_id="root")

# Add single track to playlist
add_track_to_playlist(playlist_id="136766232", track_id="218048716")

# Add multiple tracks efficiently (recommended for batch operations)
add_tracks_to_playlist(
    playlist_id="136766232",

import_track(
    path="/Users/me/Downloads/new_banger.mp3",
    rating=5,
    genre="Deep House",
)

# Batch-import a directory (recursive by default) and stage for analysis
result = import_tracks(
    paths=["/Users/me/Auditioned/March"],
    recursive=True,
    auto_tag=True,
)

# Park imports in a playlist so they're easy to find in rekordbox
create_playlist(name="Unanalyzed Imports")
add_tracks_to_playlist(
    playlist_id="<id from above>",
    track_ids=[t["track_id"] for t in result["imported"]],
)
# Then open rekordbox and run Analyze Tracks on that playlist.
```

### Reading an External Device

# Browse the playlist tree on that device
get_device_playlists(device_path="/Volumes/KBOOZ")

# Get a playlist's tracks in the order the CDJ displays them
get_device_playlist_tracks(playlist_id="97", device_path="/Volumes/KBOOZ")

# device_path can be omitted when only one device is connected
search_device_tracks(query="daft punk", limit=10)
```
